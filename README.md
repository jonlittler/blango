```

### Generic Relationships Content Types

`python manage.py shell`

```python
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from blog.models import Post

post_type = ContentType.objects.get(app_label="blog", model="post")
post_type
post_type.model_class()
post_type.get_object_for_this_type(pk=1)    # shortcut method
post_type.model_class().objects.get(pk=1)

post_type.get_object_for_this_type(pk=1) == post_type.model_class().objects.get(pk=1)

ContentType.objects.all()
ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Post)
```

By utilizing `ContentType` we can allow a model to be related to any number of models by just adding three attributes to a Model:

1. A `ForeignKey` field that points to a `ContentType`. Normally this is called content_type
2. A `PositiveIntegerField` that stores the primary key of the related object. Normally this is called object_id
3. A `GenericForeignKey` field, a special type of field that will look up the object from the other two new fields.

#### Commenting on a Post / User

`python manage.py shell`

```python
from blog.models import Post, Comment
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

p = Post.objects.first()
u = User.objects.first()

c1 = Comment(creator=u, content="What a great post!", content_object=p)
c1.save()
c1.content_object

c2 = Comment(creator=u, content="I like myself!", content_object=u)
c2.save()
c2.content_object

p.comments.all()
c3 = p.comments.all()[0]
p.comments.remove(c3)
p.comments.all()
```

### Bootstrap Setup

```html

  rel="stylesheet"
  integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcgQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC"

  integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC"
  crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

### Simple Filter Tag

In its simplest form, a filter is just a function that takes a single argument and returns a string to be rendered in the template.

> By default, Django will escape the return value. In order to render it as HTML, use `format_html`.

- create `blog/templatetags` folder
- add empty `__init__.py`
- add blogs_extra.py

Before the filter can be used, it needs to be registered into the template library. This is actually a three step process:

1. Import the django template module.
2. Create an instance of the `django.template.Library` class.
3. Register the filter function into the `Library` with its `filter` function.

### Templates

- Variable `{{ first_name }}`

- Tag `{% csrf_token %}`

The `{% for %}` tag can take an optional `{% empty %}` clause whose text is displayed if the given array is empty or could not be found.

### Crispy Forms

Since `crispy-bootstrap5` depends on `django-crispy-forms`, you only need to install `crispy-bootstrap5` with `pip` and `django-crispy-forms` will be installed automatically.

```bash
pip3 install crispy-bootstrap5
```

Open settings.py

1. Add `"crispy_forms"` and `"crispy_bootstrap5"` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
2. Add the setting `CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = "bootstrap5"`.
3. Finally, add the setting `CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "bootstrap5"`.

## Module 2

Welcome to Week 2 of the Advanced Django: Building a Blog course. These assignments cover 12 factor apps, configuring Django, logging, security, and hosting. The module ends with graded coding exercises.

Learning Objectives

- Identify the importance of 12 Factor Apps
- Define each of the 12 factors
- Define environment variable
- Reference, set, and override environment variables
- Use environment variables to configure your Django project
- Identify the different logging levels
- Add a logger to your Django project
- Use a formatter to provide more context to logging messages
- Identify import logging concepts that go beyond 12 Factor Apps
- Identify the ways in which Django is secure by default
- Define hashing and explain why it is important
- Define salting
- Explain how Django stores passwords
- Define the different methods of production hosting
- Explain the pros and cons of each production hosting method
- Describe the different factors that you should consider when selecting a hosting solution

### 12 Factors

1. Codebase - a single source repository
2. Dependencies - requirements.txt
3. Config - environment variables \*\*
4. Backing Services - database abstraction
5. Build, Release & Run
6. Processes - stateless, data stored in db
7. Port Binding - expose interface on a specific tcp port
8. Concurrency - horizontal scaling
9. Disposability - restart quickly with no data loss
10. Dev/Prod Parity - consistent tools and versions
11. Logs - write to stdout \*\*
12. Admin - one off on production

### Environment

```python
from os import environ
environ.setdefault("MY_VAR1", "Hello from PAJ")
print(f"Message: {environ["MY_VAR1"]}")
```

### Django Configurations

```bash
pip3 install django-configurations dj-database-url

# set timezone env
DJANGO_TIME_ZONE="Europe/London" python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
BLANGO_TIME_ZONE="Europe/London" python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# database url
mysql://username:password@mysql-host.example.com:3306/db_name?option1=value1&option2=value2

# /// empty hostname
sqlite:///{BASE_DIR}/db.sqlite3
```

There are a couple of things to be aware of when using `DatabaseURLValue`. It differs from the other Value classes in that it doesnâ€™t read the value from the environment variable `DJANGO_DATABASES`, as you would expect from the convention seen so far. Instead, it reads from the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`.

### Logging

- Loggers - name and level
- Handlers - where to log the message
- Filters - drop messages
- Formatters - add meta data e.g., date and time

Default security level is `WARNING`, so the logging module will not log messages with `DEBUG` and `INFO`.

https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/logging.handlers.html

### Security

```bash
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install "django[argon2]"
```

print(cache.get(f"post_{post_pk}"))

# or delete key
cache.delete(f"post_{post_pk}")

# default using sentinel
sentinel = object()
cache.set("current_user", None, 30)
u = cache.get("current_user", sentinel)
u is None       # True

    comments.append(
    Comment(creator=post.author, content="Thank you for reading my post!", content_object=post))
Comment.objects.bulk_create(comments)

# bulk update
comments = Comment.objects.filter(content="Thank you for reading my post!")
for comment in comments:
    comment.content = comment.content + " Signed, " + comment.creator.username
Comment.objects.bulk_update(comments, ["content"])

# bulk delete
Comment.objects.filter(content__contains="Thank you for reading my post!").delete()
```

## Module 3

Welcome to Week 4 of the Advanced Django: Building a Blog course. These assignments cover creating a custom user model, Django registration, and Django Allauth. The module ends with graded coding exercises.

Learning Objectives

- Explain why it is better to use a custom User model from the beginning
- Create a custom User model
- Identify when to use a custom model or a separate model
- Change authentication from username to email
- Differentiate between one-step and two-step activation
- Add login page and a profile users see once logged in
- Create two-step activation for your blog
- Send users an activation email
- Set a window for which users must activate their account
- Remove users who have not activated their accounts
- Describe the Django Allauth library
- Create a Google project through their developer portal
- Allow users to sign in with their Google credentials with Allauth
- Set up Google app credentials as a SocialApp

### Custom User Model

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/customizing/

Set up your own User model when you start your project, itâ€™s fairly simple.

1. Create a user model that inherits from `django.contrib.auth.model.AbstractUser` (it doesnâ€™t need to be called User). This can be in any app in your project, but you should consider creating an app just for authentication-related models, templates, forms and views.
2. Add the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting to point to the new Model. If youâ€™ve added the model inside a new app, make sure to add that to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
3. Register the Model in the `admin.py` for the app in which it was created.

#### Dump Data of existing user model

```bash
# backup data
python3 manage.py dumpdata -o data.json blog.Comment blog.Tag blog.Post auth.User

# create user app
python3 manage.py startapp blango_auth

# load data
python3 manage.py loaddata data.json
```

Adding a model means the content type IDs have changed, so weâ€™ll need to update all the Comment objects to point to the new content type of Post.

```python
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from blog.models import Comment, Post
post_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Post)
Comment.objects.update(content_type=post_type)
```

### Email Authentication

To implement email login we need to do the following:

- Create a new `UserManager` subclass, and override the `create_user()` and `create_superuser()` methods. We need to have the methods require an email address instead of a username.
- Update the `User` model to make the email field unique and remove the `username` field.
- Set the `User` modelâ€™s objects attribute to an instance of the new user manager.
- Set the `User` modelâ€™s `USERNAME_FIELD` to "email".
- Set the `User` modelâ€™s `REQUIRED_FIELDS` to an empty list. This might seem strange, because by default this value is `["email"]`, however Django assumes the `USERNAME_FIELD` is required, and so doesnâ€™t allow it to be listed in `REQUIRED_FIELDS`.
- Change the `__str__()` method of User to return the email address.
  Subclass django.contrib.auth.admin.UserAdmin and remove any reference to username or replace with email.

> What does \_("email address") mean?

The first positional argument for an EmailField is the label. The method `_()` is typically `gettext_lazy` or `gettext` but aliased to `_`.

This is done via (specific example in the docs 2):

```python
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
```

The function gettext_lazy is used to support internationalization of text.
